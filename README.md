# 🐍 Snake Game  

A modern take on the classic Snake game, built using **JavaScript** and the HTML5 Canvas API. This project is part of my learning journey in game development, combining logic, creativity, and fun!

## 🎮 Features  
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows as it eats the fruit.  
- **Circular Fruit**: Modern aesthetics with smooth, circular fruit.  
- **Score Tracking**: See your score increase with each bite.  
- **Sound Effects**: A fun "eating" sound effect to enhance the experience.  
- **Smooth Controls**: Control the snake using `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys.  

## 🚀 Planned Features  
- **Obstacle Mode**: Add challenges to avoid as the snake grows.  
- **Thematic Skins**: Customize the snake and fruit with different colors or themes.  
- **Portal Mechanics**: Make the snake teleport across the screen for advanced gameplay.  
- **Speed Increase**: Gradual difficulty as the snake moves faster over time.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5 Canvas API**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **CSS** for basic styling
